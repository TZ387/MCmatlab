%% Description
% This example is exactly the same as example 1, except that GPU
% acceleration is utilized by executing on an Nvidia GPU through the CUDA
% architecture. If you have a CUDA-capable GPU you can launch MCmatlab
% with this acceleration by setting model.MC.useGPU = true, as seen below.
% 
% On my Windows test PC with an Intel i5-6600 CPU and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 970
% GPU, the speedup is a factor of 10-15x.
% 
% Currently, only one GPU will be used even if you have multiple GPUs
% installed. If you are interested in using multiple GPUs in parallel,
% contact the MCmatlab developer Anders K. Hansen at ankrh@fotonik.dtu.dk

%% Post-processing

%% Geometry function(s)
% A geometry function takes as input X,Y,Z matrices as returned by the
% "ndgrid" MATLAB function as well as any parameters the user may have
% provided in the definition of Ginput. It returns the media matrix M,
% containing numerical values indicating the media type (as defined in
% mediaPropertiesFunc) at each voxel location.
function M = geometryDefinition_StandardTissue(X,Y,Z,parameters)
tissuedepth = 0.03;
M = ones(size(X)); % Air
M(Z > tissuedepth) = 2; % "Standard" tissue
end

%% Media Properties function
% The media properties function defines all the optical and thermal
% properties of the media involved by constructing and returning a
% "mediaProperties" struct with various fields. As its input, the function
% takes the wavelength as well as any other parameters you might specify
% above in the model file, for example parameters that you might loop over
% in a for loop. Dependence on excitation fluence rate FR, temperature T or
% fractional heat damage FD can be specified as in examples 12-15.
