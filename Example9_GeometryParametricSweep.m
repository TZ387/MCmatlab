%% Description
% This example shows how to execute MC simulations in a for loop, in this
% case simulating a pencil beam incident on a slab of "standard tissue"
% with variable (parametrically sweeped) thickness. The slab thickness is
% passed in as a part of the GeomFuncParams field and used in the geometry
% function to get the correct thickness. Light is collected in transmission
% at a 45Â° angle in a fiber. A small layer of air is present underneath the
% slab so that the refraction out of the slab is correctly modeled. At the
% end of the script, collected power as a function of thickness is plotted.
% The fiber-coupled power is seen to be zero for zero slab thickness, since
% there is nothing to scatter the light over into the fiber, and the power
% starts to drop off when the slab thickness passes 0.05 cm because then
% much of the light is either absorbed or scattered backwards rather than
% into the fiber.
%
% Lz and nz have been carefully chosen so that the slab interfaces always
% coincide with voxel boundaries, so we get exactly correct slab
% thicknesses in all the iterations of the for loop. Otherwise, the
% simulated slab thickness would deviate from the specified slab thickness
% because of the voxel rounding during the geometry definition.
%
% The silentMode flags are used here, which suppress the outputs to the
% command line, which is especially useful to avoid excessive text if
% simulating in a for- or while-loop like this.
% 
% Also, the optional calcNFR flag in the MCinput is here set to false, which
% means the MC simulation does not calculate the 3D fluence rate matrix.
% This is useful because we're here only interested in the "image" data,
% and setting calcF to false will speed up the simulation a bit (10-30%).
