%% Description
% In this introductory example, a block of "standard tissue" (mu_a = 1,
% mu_s = 100, g = 0.9) is illuminated by a pencil beam (infinitely thin
% beam). A small slice of air is present in the top of the simulation
% volume. nx and ny are set to odd values so that when the pencil beam is
% launched at x = y = 0 and travels straight down, it travels along a
% well-defined center column of voxels (the middle of the 51st column). Use
% the log10 plot checkbox in the visualizations to better see the fluence
% rate and absorption distribution in the MC result.
%
% For a pencil beam, the "waist" and "divergence" quantities are not used.

%% Post-processing

%% Geometry function(s)
% A geometry function takes as input X,Y,Z matrices as returned by the
% "ndgrid" MATLAB function as well as any parameters the user may have
% provided in the definition of Ginput. It returns the media matrix M,
% containing numerical values indicating the media type (as defined in
% getMediaProperties) at each voxel location.
function M = GeometryDefinition_StandardTissue(X,Y,Z,parameters)
tissuedepth = 0.03;
M = ones(size(X)); % Air
M(Z > tissuedepth) = 2; % "Standard" tissue
end

%% Media Properties function
% The media properties function defines all the optical and thermal
% properties of the media involved by constructing and returning a
% "mediaProperties" struct with various fields. As its input, the function
% takes the wavelength as well as any other parameters you might specify
% above in the model file, for example parameters that you might loop over
% in a for loop.
function mediaProperties = mediaPropertiesFunc(wavelength,parameters)
