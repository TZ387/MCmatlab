%% Geometry function(s)
% A geometry function takes as input X,Y,Z matrices as returned by the
% "ndgrid" MATLAB function as well as any parameters the user may have
% provided in the definition of Ginput. It returns the media matrix M,
% containing numerical values indicating the media type (as defined in
% getMediaProperties) at each voxel location.

M = ones(size(X)); % Air
